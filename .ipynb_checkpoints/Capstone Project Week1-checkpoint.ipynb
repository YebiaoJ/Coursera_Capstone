    "Nowadays people rely more and more on vehicle GPS for navigation. Even at an unfamiliar area, people will feel much more confident at driving than ever before but neglect some safety issue sometimes. Driving at an unfamiliar street, it's not enough to know the road or traffic condition. Safety is always at priority to be considered. It's of obiligation and necessicity for GPS producer to add the feature for predicting the accident severity considerred considering all the relevant information, e.g. weather, road condition, real-time traffic, etc. Wouldn't it be great of a vehicle GPS being able to warn the driver of all the possible accidents ahead? So driver could keep careful ahead of time or even change route if being able to. Taking care of what consumers really need, even if they are not aware, is the way to succeed. "

    "Machine learning has been a trustworthy role in solving such problem. With abundant data, we can develop a model predicting the accident severity or even possibility for each route head and thus the GPS can help pick the safest route for the drivers and warn them to pay more attention when they drive into a risky area, like a busy and wet crossroad with no roadlight. With classification models, such as logistic regression, machine learning can easily handle such task."

Within the dataset, there're 38 columns and 194674 rows. Among the 38 columns, we have our target variable\n",
